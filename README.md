# INTRODUCTION

This report presents the design and implementation of a forward converter that operates with an input voltage range of 36-60 V DC, providing a primary output of 5 V at 8 A along with a secondary auxiliary output of 12 V at 4 W. The forward converter is a type of DC-to-DC converter that transfers power during the forward operation of a transformer, making it suitable for applications requiring isolated and regulated outputs.

To achieve precise control over the output voltage, the design employs an analog controller integrated with a feedforward loop. The primary side of the converter utilizes a single switch, while the transformer flux is reset using an additional winding and a diode. This approach ensures efficient operation and prevents magnetic saturation of the transformer core.

In low-voltage, high-current applications, traditional diode-based rectification becomes less efficient due to the voltage drop across the diodes, typically around 0.5 V. To address this inefficiency, synchronous rectification is implemented using MOSFETs at the output. When conducting, a MOSFET with a 10-milliohm resistance produces a voltage drop of only 0.1 V at 10 A, significantly improving overall efficiency.

The printed circuit board (PCB) for this design is manufactured using a photolithography process. This process includes applying a photoresistive UV coating and etching the copper layer using a solution of hydrogen peroxide and hydrochloric acid. The circuit's functionality is thoroughly tested under various load conditions, including overload scenarios and auxiliary load operation, to validate its performance and reliability.

This report further discusses the chosen topology, magnetic design, and key considerations in achieving an efficient, compact, and robust forward converter design.

# TOPOLOGY

The forward converter is a widely used topology in DC-to-DC conversion, especially for applications requiring electrical isolation and multiple outputs. This topology operates by transferring energy through a transformer during the on-state of the primary-side switch, with energy delivery controlled by the duty cycle of the switch.

The duty ratio, defined as the proportion of time the primary switch is on during a switching cycle, is a critical parameter in determining the output voltage of the forward converter. The relationship between the input voltage, duty ratio, and transformer turns ratio governs the output voltage. A feedback mechanism ensures the duty ratio is adjusted dynamically to maintain a stable output under varying input and load conditions.

The forward converter design includes a bias supply for the primary side, which provides the necessary power to the control circuitry and auxiliary components. This supply is derived from the bias winding connected to the primary side. The circuit initially starts with a voltage divider and a zener diode. As the bias winding experiences a change in flux, it supplies the rest of the circuit with the required voltage. The output of the bias winding is configured as a rectifier of a forward converter and is regulated with a linear regulator constructed from an NPN transistor. This sets the bias supply to approximately 12 volts.

The secondary side of the converter includes an auxiliary output in addition to the primary output. This output is set to 12 volts and is rated for 0.3 amperes, resulting in a 4 W auxiliary output. The auxiliary output is supplied from another auxiliary winding with a forward rectifier output. This output is also regulated using a 12-volt linear regulator and is referenced to the ground of the secondary winding.

# MAGNETIC DESIGN

Magnetic design is a critical aspect of the forward converter, as it directly impacts efficiency, size, and reliability. The transformer in the forward converter serves two primary purposes: providing electrical isolation and stepping the voltage up or down based on the turns ratio.

A forward converter utilizes a transformer operating in forward mode, meaning that energy is transferred directly through the transformer core during the on-state of the primary switch. Unlike some other topologies, energy is not stored in the core during one cycle and transferred in the next; instead, the transfer is immediate.

The magnetic design is done in a MATLAB script that calculates key parameters for a forward converter, focusing on component sizing and operational constraints. It starts by defining input/output voltage ranges, power requirements, efficiency assumptions, and ripple constraints. The output current and its ripple are calculated to establish operating boundaries.

A significant part of the script focuses on determining the duty cycle range as a function of the transformer turns ratio (\(N_1/N_2\)) and selecting an optimal ratio to ensure the converter operates within specified limits. Transformer design calculations include determining winding turns for primary, secondary, and auxiliary windings while ensuring compliance with voltage and current constraints, such as switch voltage limits.

The script calculates the magnetizing inductance (\(L_m\)) and evaluates the impact of switching frequency on inductor performance. It also designs the output filter components to meet ripple voltage constraints.

Core selection is supported by area product (\(A_p\)) calculations using various methods, ensuring the chosen core can handle the required flux and thermal limits. Wire gauge and winding distribution are calculated to balance current density and copper usage.

Finally, the script includes a loss analysis, estimating core and copper losses, and evaluates leakage inductance to ensure the design meets efficiency and performance goals. This approach focuses on key aspects of forward converter design while avoiding unnecessary complexity.
